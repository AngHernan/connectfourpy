This is my connect four game that I built with Python. The main module or entrance is the 'userinter.py' file. Purely text based game with a normal 'Drop' version of the game and 'Pop' version as well. 

The program was my first insight into using multiple modules and introduction to object oriented programing. 

Click on run and start to get it running. 

The game will prompt the current player for a move.
